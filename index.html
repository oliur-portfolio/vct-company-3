                        <h1>The Company<span>Our History</span></h1>

                        <p>Twenty years ago our Chief Scientist, Charles Dixon, embraced the challenge of realizing the powerful potential inherent in the aerodynamics of vortex flow. All aircraft produce vortices in flight: at the wing tips, the aft fuselage and at the wing to fuselage interface. If these vortices can be controlled and manipulated then aircraft performance can be improved. Most engineers have stayed away from this phenomenon because the physics are not well understood, and the mathematics involve formulas and algorithms that either have no solution or require far too much computer computational capacity to arrive at an answer in a reasonable amount of time. The physics of vortex flow are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations of turbulent flow - and to illustrate how difficult this problem is, the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts (CMI) has established a million dollar prize to anyone who can solve these equations for turbulent vortex flow.</p>

                        <p>Although there is no known mathematical solution that can be quickly and easily applied, VCT has approached the problem through a combination of analytical and empirical methods involving wind tunnel and flight test data. This approach has produced unique, proprietary, proven technologies that have resulted in software copyrights and patents for concepts that have been flight test proven on multiple aircraft types. Also, these concepts have been successfully demonstrated using computational fluid dynamics.</p>

                                                    <p>Chuck has over 40 years of experience in the aerospace field with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company as a Senior Research Scientist and later as the founder and president of his own aerospace consulting company. Chuck has extensive experience in virtually all areas of Flight Sciences and is a nationally recognized expert in the field of vortex flow phenomenon. He is the originator of the Company's proprietary aerodynamic prediction software, which has the unique capability of predicting vortex flow and post-stall aerodynamic characteristics for aircraft. He is the patent holder of two innovative devices for vortex flow applications: one delays wing stall (VC Eaglets), and the second reduces drag on upward swept fuselage aircraft (VC Finlets). He has also conducted investigations on a variety of R&D projects, including extensive work on both passive and powered high lift concepts. These investigations included both analytical and experimental programs. Chuck's education includes a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Georgia State University. He is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), has authored 7 AIAA technical papers and is author/co-author of multiple US patents. He was the recipient of the Ben T. Epps award in 2007 for the best aerospace invention in Georgia granted by the Aerospace Innovation Center of Georgia.</p>

Chuck has extensive experience in virtually all areas of Flight Sciences and is a nationally recognized expert in the field of vortex flow phenomenon. He is the originator of the Company's proprietary aerodynamic prediction software, which has the unique capability of predicting vortex flow and post-stall aerodynamic characteristics for aircraft. He is the patent holder of two innovative devices for vortex flow applications: one delays wing stall (VC Eaglets), and the second reduces drag on upward swept fuselage aircraft (VC Finlets). He has also conducted investigations on a variety of R&D projects, including extensive work on both passive and powered high lift concepts. These investigations included both analytical and experimental programs. Chuck's education includes a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Georgia State University. He is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), has authored 7 AIAA technical papers and is author/co-author of multiple US patents. He was the recipient of the Ben T. Epps award in 2007 for the best aerospace invention in Georgia granted by the Aerospace Innovation Center of Georgia.</p>

                                                    <p>John R. Hooker has over 40 years of experience in the aerospace field with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company as a Senior Research Scientist and later as the founder and president of his own aerospace consulting company. Chuck has extensive experience in virtually all areas of Flight Sciences and is a nationally recognized expert in the field of vortex flow phenomenon. He is the originator of the Company's proprietary aerodynamic prediction software, which has the unique capability of predicting vortex flow and post-stall aerodynamic characteristics for aircraft. He is the patent holder of two innovative devices for vortex flow applications: one delays wing stall (VC Eaglets), and the second reduces drag on upward swept fuselage aircraft (VC Finlets). He has also conducted investigations on a variety of R&D projects, including extensive work on both passive and powered high lift concepts. These investigations included both analytical and experimental programs. Chuck's education includes a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Georgia State University. He is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), has authored 7 AIAA technical papers and is author/co-author of multiple US patents. He was the recipient of the Ben T. Epps award in 2007 for the best aerospace invention in Georgia granted by the Aerospace Innovation Center of Georgia.</p>

                                                    <p>Bryan S. Jenkins has over 40 years of experience in the aerospace field with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company as a Senior Research Scientist and later as the founder and president of his own aerospace consulting company. Chuck has extensive experience in virtually all areas of Flight Sciences and is a nationally recognized expert in the field of vortex flow phenomenon. He is the originator of the Company's proprietary aerodynamic prediction software, which has the unique capability of predicting vortex flow and post-stall aerodynamic characteristics for aircraft. He is the patent holder of two innovative devices for vortex flow applications: one delays wing stall (VC Eaglets), and the second reduces drag on upward swept fuselage aircraft (VC Finlets). He has also conducted investigations on a variety of R&D projects, including extensive work on both passive and powered high lift concepts. These investigations included both analytical and experimental programs. Chuck's education includes a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Georgia State University. He is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), has authored 7 AIAA technical papers and is author/co-author of multiple US patents. He was the recipient of the Ben T. Epps award in 2007 for the best aerospace invention in Georgia granted by the Aerospace Innovation Center of Georgia.</p>

                                                    <p>Chuck has over 40 years of experience in the aerospace field with Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company as a Senior Research Scientist and later as the founder and president of his own aerospace consulting company. Chuck has extensive experience in virtually all areas of Flight Sciences and is a nationally recognized expert in the field of vortex flow phenomenon. He is the originator of the Company's proprietary aerodynamic prediction software, which has the unique capability of predicting vortex flow and post-stall aerodynamic characteristics for aircraft. He is the patent holder of two innovative devices for vortex flow applications: one delays wing stall (VC Eaglets), and the second reduces drag on upward swept fuselage aircraft (VC Finlets). He has also conducted investigations on a variety of R&D projects, including extensive work on both passive and powered high lift concepts. These investigations included both analytical and experimental programs. Chuck's education includes a Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California and an MBA from Georgia State University. He is an Associate Fellow of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), has authored 7 AIAA technical papers and is author/co-author of multiple US patents. He was the recipient of the Ben T. Epps award in 2007 for the best aerospace invention in Georgia granted by the Aerospace Innovation Center of Georgia.</p>
